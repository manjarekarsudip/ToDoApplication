Developed a full-stack ToDo application using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and Tomcat. 
The app allows users to manage tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. 
The application features a responsive front-end built with Bootstrap and JavaScript. 
Deployed the application on a Tomcat server and configured it for public access. 
Integrated a back-end with CRUD operations using Spring Boot and connected it to a MySQL database for persistent storage.
